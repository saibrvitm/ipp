   - Dynamic game grid that adapts to different difficulty levels
   - Real-time score and moves counter
   - Smooth card flip animations
   - Particle effects for successful matches

2. Game Mechanics:
   - Card matching with emoji symbols (ðŸŽ®, ðŸŽ², ðŸŽ¯, ðŸŽ¨, ðŸŽ­, ðŸŽª, ðŸŽ«)
   - Configurable grid sizes (4x4, 6x6)
   - Score tracking based on moves and time
   - Automatic win condition detection
   - Card flip animations with rotation effects

3. User Interface Components:
   - Splash screen with animated card preview
   - Main menu with animated transitions
   - Settings screen with theme options
   - Scoreboard with persistent high scores
   - Game screen with dynamic card grid

4. Visual Effects:
   - Particle effects for successful matches
   - Card flip animations with 3D rotation
